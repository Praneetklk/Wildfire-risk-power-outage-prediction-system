# Wildfire Risk & Power Outage Prediction System

This project analyzes wildfire risk and power outage probabilities using geographic, infrastructure, and weather data. Built in collaboration with DTE Energy, it integrates clustering, risk scoring, and an interactive GUI for emergency response planning.

## Features
- GIS-based risk assessment using ArcGIS overlays
- Python clustering models to identify high-risk zones
- GUI to visualize wildfire and outage probabilities
- Data integration from weather and infrastructure sources

## Tech Stack
- Python, ArcGIS, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- ArcGIS for GIS Visualization
- Tkinter or Dash for GUI
- CSV for sample datasets
